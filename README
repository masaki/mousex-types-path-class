DESCRIPTION
    MouseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Mouse types, coercions and
    option specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as
    Mouse attributes.

    Coercions (see Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both "Str"
    and "ArrayRef" to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects.
    If you have MouseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s") will
    be added for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.

TYPES
  Dir
        A Path::Class::Dir class type.

        Coerces from "Str" and "ArrayRef" via "new" in Path::Class::Dir.

  File
        A Path::Class::File class type.

        Coerces from "Str" and "ArrayRef" via "new" in Path::Class::File.
